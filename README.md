We are creating a Funding  DAO, where people can use MATIC tokens to become either a Member or Stakeholder in the DAO. Members can apply for funding for their project and Stakeholders can vote on the projects to fund from the DAO treasury.

Users can provide up to 5 MATIC tokens to become a Member of the DAO and can provide more than 5 tokens to become a Stakeholder in the DAO.

A Member can create new proposals and request funding. Every new proposal requires the Member to add 3 MATIC tokens to the DAO treasury.

If the proposal is accepted after the voting period the initial 3 MATIC tokens are refunded, otherwise the tokens are reserved in the DAO treasury.

When a Member creates a new proposal Stakeholders have 3 days to vote on the proposal, either in favor or against it.
